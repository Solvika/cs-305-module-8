Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis financial consulting organization that hired Worldwide Rain, and therefore me, to create a web application to help them with their job. Artemis Monetary provides its clients with savings, retirement, investment, and insurance options. Worldwide Downpour has been hired to develop an application that allows clients to upload files and access accounts, with the primary goal of ensuring information delivery.


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
My approach to incorporating security layers in the program revolved on the use of various encryption calculations. In light of the upcoming transition, distinct areas of the program will require different approaches to security. For example, certain formulas are simpler/more suited for validating data within a record, whilst others are more focused on client certification validation. A comprehensive encryption/security technique is something I'm interested in learning more about for future applications and projects.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

As far as usefulness, I tried every part of the web application exclusively prior to testing for appropriate reconciliation of inner and outside assets.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

This project included extensive documentation for the Spring framework as well as training on how to produce and read vulnerability reports. I feel that reading the documentation for a certain tool or programming language may be useful, especially when dealing with a technology that you are new with.



Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would feature the weakness reports, or, all the more explicitly, the documentation and translation I made in light of the report's decisions. Seeing such security reports, as I would like to think, is a significant component of web advancement, especially for planned businesses. While I'm not completely certain in that frame of mind to peruse and dissect these reports, I really do accept that this work has shown me a way to more prominent comprehension.
